2. Installation
----------------

Windows:
--------

Make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware patch.
Install the official patch BEFORE installing any unofficial modifications.

To save you time and effort, it is recommended to backup dialog.tlk, chitin.key,
baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory before installing any mods.
This way, you can restore your "clean install" in seconds by deleting weidu.log,
dialog.tlk, chitin.key, baldur.ini, bgmain.exe and override directory,
and restoring backups.

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack the mod into your game directory and run Setup-DC.exe. 

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-DC.exe in your game directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.
If properly extracted, you should have a DC folder,
Setup-DC, and Setup-DC.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-DC.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-DC.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-DC
into the window, press enter.
3. Double-click Setup-DC.command,
the installation process should now proceed.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-DC.command
in your game directory.

3. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: So, what is it about?
A: Play and find out!

Q: Where to start?
A: Look for new characters in the Copper Coronet.
Q: But they are not there!
A: Make sure that you have actually installed the mod. Open your game directory
and run Setup-DC.exe. If this file is not there, repeat the installation process
as described above.

Q: I have a problem with one of the quests.
A: Listen to what the characters say, and check your journal.

Q: Is Dungeon Crawl compatible with mod X?
A: Dungeon Crawl should work fine with other mods. Read each Readme file
for the additional information and the installation orders.

Q: I am stuck and I need a walkthrough.
A: Here it is.
1) First, head to the Copper Coronet and receive the task from Durnkrag.
2) Grudin can be found on the left side of the slums at night.
3) Return to the Copper Coronet and tell Durnkrag what you saw.
4) Head after the party to the docks, to the south of the district, to 
the stairs down.
5) Support whatever party you will.
6) Talk to the captain downstairs. If you choose to proceed, you have to pay
one thousand for the passage.
7) You end up in the dungeon and split up with the other party. Explore the
dungeon as you will. Lepus will be waiting for you upstairs, in the fourth area.

WARNING: Once you have entered the area with Lepus, you cannot turn back!

8) Lepus has a lot of hitpoints. After he is defeated, the group appears, and 
you are teleported back, to the roof of the Copper Coronet.
9) If you supported Durnkrag(good guys), go to the Copper Coronet for your 
reward.
